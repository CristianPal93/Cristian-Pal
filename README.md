This is a small project about my car's factory replacement radio.This car's radio is special because the factory radio contains the climatronic control so... it's harder to replace.Sadly I wasn't abble to find a aftermarket replacement wich can handle the my car's climatronic so i decided to build my own android head unit of course is still in working progress but all in all I've manage to make a working prototype.The hardware used is an android tablet ,otg cable, a anduino mega developing board  and some electronic components (resistors,transistors,caps).Don't worry the electronic components needed are in the old factory radio so we will recycle some old stuff :).The project is simple in the  project folder you will find two pieces of software the UI for the Android and firmware for the Arduino you will find the gerber files for the pcb and last but not least the schematic of the old factory radio.Feel free to modify for your needs! but if you mention me in your work I will appreciate that! I also thank the user Felipe Herranz aka felHR85 for helping me with usb comunication part so Thanks Felipe Harranz!! Happy Hacking!!
